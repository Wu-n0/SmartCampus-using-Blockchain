# SmartCampus-using-Blockchain
INTRODUCTION

Focused on creating an incentive program that can track how students behaved on a decentralized
blockchain. Students would be awarded cryptocurrency called "BitsToken" for good behavior and have
their currency taken away for bad behavior. All transactions and currency are stored on the blockchain.



IMPLEMENTATION

After creating a private blockchain, we deploy our smart contracts onto our private blockchain. The smartcontract has the following functions:

BitsToken - It is the name of the cryptocurrency that is given out to students as an incentive to do good things on campus. This function creates the token everytime the use does something deemed good.

Add User - Adds a new user to the blockchain 

Destroy Token - Used to delete tokens on the blockchain when a user does something deemed a bad deed. 

Transfer Token - Transfers tokens from one account to another

Disable Account - Temporarily disables the users account if he continues to only do bad deeds or doesn't follow the rules



MOTIVATION

To create a blockchain technology that can be implemented in our every day life.
