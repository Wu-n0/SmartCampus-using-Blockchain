# SmartCampus using Blockchain

## Introduction

I am deeply engaged in the development of an innovative incentive program that leverages decentralized blockchain technology to monitor and reward student behavior. The primary aim is to establish a system where students are incentivized with a cryptocurrency called "BitsToken" for exhibiting positive conduct while facing deductions for engaging in undesirable behavior. All transactions and currency holdings are securely stored on the blockchain.

## Implementation

To realize this vision, we have constructed a private blockchain infrastructure where we deploy our carefully crafted smart contracts. These contracts encompass a set of essential functions:

1. **BitsToken**: This function generates the BitsToken cryptocurrency as a reward for students who demonstrate commendable actions within the campus environment.

2. **Add User**: By employing this function, we facilitate the seamless addition of new users to our blockchain network, enabling them to participate in the incentive program.

3. **Destroy Token**: Whenever a user engages in behavior deemed inappropriate, this function allows the removal of corresponding tokens from the blockchain, discouraging undesirable actions.

4. **Transfer Token**: With this function, users can transfer their accumulated tokens between different accounts, promoting a fluid exchange of value within the incentive system.

5. **Disable Account**: In cases where a user persistently engages in negative behavior or fails to adhere to established rules, this function temporarily disables their account, promoting accountability and encouraging compliance.

## Motivation

My driving motivation behind this project is to develop blockchain technology that can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, addressing real-world challenges and fostering positive behavioral change. By utilizing the inherent transparency and security of blockchain, we can establish an effective incentive program with far-reaching applications.
